# 🛡️ VoiceFIR  
### Your Voice for Justice

VoiceFIR is a voice-first system that helps citizens generate a structured First Information Report (FIR) by simply describing an incident in their own words.

FIR filing in India is often intimidating due to complex legal language, lack of awareness, and emotional stress after an incident. VoiceFIR removes these barriers by allowing users to speak freely while the system handles legal structuring and formatting.
